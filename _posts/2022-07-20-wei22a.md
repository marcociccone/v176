title: '2021 BEETL Competition: Advancing Transfer Learning for Subject Independence
  and Heterogenous EEG Data Sets'
abstract: Transfer learning and meta-learning offer some of the most promising avenues
  to unlock the scalability of healthcare and consumer technologies driven by biosignal
  data. This is because regular machine learning methods cannot generalise well across
  human subjects and handle learning from different, heterogeneously collected data
  sets, thus limiting the scale of training data available. On the other hand, the
  many developments in transfer- and meta-learning fields would benefit significantly
  from a real-world benchmark with immediate practical application. Therefore, we
  pick electroencephalography (EEG) as an exemplar for all the things that make biosignal
  data analysis a hard problem. We design two transfer learning challenges around
  a. clinical diagnostics and b. neurotechnology. These two challenges are designed
  to probe algorithmic performance with all the challenges of biosignal data, such
  as low signal-to-noise ratios, major variability among subjects, differences in
  the data recording sessions and techniques, and even between the specific BCI tasks
  recorded in the dataset. Task 1 is centred on the field of medical diagnostics,
  addressing automatic sleep stage annotation across subjects. Task 2 is centred on
  Brain-Computer Interfacing (BCI), addressing motor imagery decoding across both
  subjects and data sets. The successful 2021 BEETL competition with its over 30 competing
  teams and its 3 winning entries brought attention to the potential of deep transfer
  learning and combinations of set theory and conventional machine learning techniques
  to overcome the challenges. The results set a new state-of-the-art for the real-world
  BEETL benchmarks.
