title: 'AME: Interpretable Almost Exact Matching for Causal Inference'
abstract: 'AME-GUI (Almost Matching Exactly Graphical User Interface) is an interactive web- based application that allows users to perform matching for causal inference on large, complex datasets with categorical covariates. The application is powered by the Fast Large-Scale Almost Matching Exactly (FLAME) algorithm (Wang et al., 2021), which matches treatment and control units in a way that is (i) interpretable, because the matches are made directly on covariates, (ii) high-quality, because machine learning is used to determine which covariates are important to match on, and (iii) scalable, using techniques from data management. The graphical user interface highlights the utility of this algorithm and uses a suite of visualization tools to facilitate easy and interactive exploration of treatment effect estimates, as well as of the created matched groups that they depend on. The application gives a quick and simple overview of the open-source Python and R packages dame-flame and FLAME, and the range of functionality they provide for interpretable and efficient causal inference.'
